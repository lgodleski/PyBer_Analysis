# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to show and compare the differences in ride-sharing data among different city types (rural, urban, and suburban).

## Results
- Looking at this overview of the data, we can see that urban cities have the highest number of total rides, the highest number of total drivers and fares, the lowest average fare per ride, and the lowest average fare per driver. Rural cities, conversely, have the lowest number of total rides, the lowest number of total drivers and fares, the highest average fare per ride, and the highest average fare per driver.
